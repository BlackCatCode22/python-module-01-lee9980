# Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
# answer: c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle

# Exercise 2: What is a program?
# answer: programs are a set of instructions a computer follows to preform various tasks

# Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
# answer: a compiler translates a piece of code all at once while a interperter does it
# line by line.

# Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?
# a) The Python interpreter

# Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:
# >>> primt 'Hello world!'
# File "<stdin>", line 1
#  primt 'Hello world!'
#                    ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
# >>>
#  answer: it is a syntax error, a misspelling of the keyword "print"

# Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?
# x = 123
# answer: b) Main Memory

# Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
# x = 43
# x = x - 1
# print(x)
# answer: 42

# Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example,
# “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?
# answer: to answer this ill go one by one.
# central processing unit will of course be the brain, processing information, and instructions for example.
# the main memory would specifically be the prefrontal lobe, as it stores all our short term memories.
# the secondary memory would be our hippocampus (part of the brain) as it stores our long term memories.
# the input device could be our 5 senses since we are basically gaining input from everything we see,
# taste, touch, smell, and hear.
# And lastly our output device could be our reactions? how we react to what we "input". For example, responding
# positively or negatively to some ones comment about a shirt we're wearing.
